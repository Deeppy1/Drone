<h1>3d Printed Drone Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Im currently attempting to create and 3d print a drone using an Esp32 and some old motors I had lying around </h2>
<h2> At the moment im soring out motor controllers and connecting my xbox controller</h2>
<h1>How im doing it</h1>
<br>
<h2>Im using a libary called bluepad32 this allows me to connect a controller (i.e. xbox or playstation or a long list of others) and use that to set variables and control motors</h2>
<h2>along with this im going to make the entire thing opensource from code to desighn files</h2>
